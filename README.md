# Matrimony App

This is a Matrimony web app made entirely with Meteor. This does not uses the latest Meteor 1.2 as the update has breaking changes to this app. so if you directly clone this repo it might not work. To use this, you will have to use the previos version 1.1.0.3. 

To run this app, 

Install Meteor:

`curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh`


Then downgrade

`meteor update --release 1.1.0.3`

then, 

`git clone https://github.com/kaiyes/Matrimony.git`

`cd Matrimony`

`cd practise`

then finally run the app at `localhost:3000` by typing in your terminal

 `Meteor`
